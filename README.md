Dendro Recommender
=====================================

Descriptor recommender module for Dendro

The Dendro platform is a completely open-source platform designed to help researchers describe their datasets, fully build on Linked Open Data. It is designed to capture data and metadata during the research workflow. Whenever researchers want to publish a dataset, they can export to repositories such as [CKAN](http://ckan.org/), [DSpace](http://www.dspace.org/), [Invenio](http://invenio-software.org/), or [EUDAT's B2Share](https://www.eudat.eu/services/b2share). Any repository can be added by writing small plug-ins.

It is under development at [Faculdade de Engenharia da Universidade do Porto](https://www.fe.up.pt/)'s [Infolab](http://infolab.fe.up.pt) since 2013. If you are interested in the academic foundations and innovations behind Dendro, please check out our **publications** at the [Dendro official website](http://dendro.fe.up.pt).


You are free to use Dendro to build any service for your research group or institution.
