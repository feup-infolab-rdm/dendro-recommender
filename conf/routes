# NOTE FOR SMART PEOPLE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
# Routes are not very restful (i. e. identifiers inside the routes)
# because sometimes identifiers are urls, and urls inside URLs are a mess...
# would require messy escaping and unescaping.
# For now everything is sent in JSON objects.
